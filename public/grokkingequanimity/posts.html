<div id='posts'><div id='post'><div id='posttitle'>DevOps for Software Developers, not Computer Engineers</div><div id='postdate'>Tue May 26 2015 18:15:19 GMT-0700 (PDT)</div><br><div id='posttext'>I am enjoying a ride on a great wave into the age of cloud computing, where old hardware + software legacy infrastructure is looking utterly decrepit, and where solutions like Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos, Rocket, and Azure are the young and spicy choices for the next generation of DevOps.<br><br>Take a breather.<br><br>The point of this post is that software developers in the next generation will not be confused and will not need to meddle with a layer of messy "hardware infrastructure." I think Apache Mesos sums it up nicely:<blockquote cite="http://mesos.apache.org/">Program against your datacenter like itâ€™s a single pool of resources.</blockquote>This implies that developers within a startup of the next generation can deal with a single endpoint (server address, hosted on the strength of a cluster of machines), which can reliably handle incoming requests from all the company's users.<br><br>As an engineer I see this as a chance to add additional low-level programming language features which handle these additional resources. A system which organizes a cluster of machines will be built into a languages' framework such that, code handling an incoming request, will automatically send it to the proper machine (load balancing) on the cluster which has the proper available resource (process, disk space, CPU, etc...).<br><br>The architecture which hosts this blog as an "app", is prepared for this new wave. For each app a new NodeJS process is spawned. This is forward-looking in the sense that, load balancing is intuitive (spawn the process somewhere else). However, I do not think that the current set of options are completely realized. Docker has an odd set of terminology which fits their architecture nicely but not really my mind. Apache Mesos appears promising with a nice master/slave machine configuration scheme, but I'm not sold. I'm looking for some high-quality NodeJS packages which handle cluster management at a low level so that I can find out where my MongoDB server is at run-time and give my other apps the right address.<br><br>I'm skeptical as to how much I actually know about the topic, so that is all for now. The point is yet still, that these first-generation cluster computing solutions are not seamless. I see NodeJS as a way to seamlessly serve requests of all kinds, handle app spawning, and do other computation. I do not yet see Docker or Kubernetes as seamless integration. I think for a long while I will be manually configuring and balancing a small set of NodeJS-optimized servers. Cheers to simplicity.</div></div><hr><div id='post'><div id='posttitle'>Developing with NodeJS</div><div id='postdate'>Mon May 25 2015 23:15:30 GMT-0700 (PDT)</div><br><div id='posttext'>I've had a great time working on the series of apps located at bwackwat.com. I plan to sharpen the sites and work on some nice NodeJS-based "app" infrastructure. In the future I will consider using Docker for scalability purposes. In addition, although MongoDB integrates nicely with both Javascript objects and my brain's organization, I am interested in entertaining the idea of using Redis, or an ACID compatible database.<br>As for NodeJS:  Javascript is awesome to use for front and back end work, the community of coders and support for libraries is good if not great, and I am enjoying it's ease of deployment. I hope it can scale. MongoDB is great for general document storage.<br>I am really looking forward to having more fun with WebSockets.</div></div><hr></div>
