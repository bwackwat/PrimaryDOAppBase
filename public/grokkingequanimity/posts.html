I plan to sharpen the sites and work on some nice NodeJS-based "app" infrastructure. In the future I will consider using Docker for scalability purposes. In addition, although MongoDB integrates nicely with both Javascript objects and my brain's organization, I am interested in entertaining the idea of using Redis, or an ACID compatible database.<br>As for NodeJS:  Javascript is awesome to use for front and back end work, the community of coders and support for libraries is good if not great, and I am enjoying it's ease of deployment. I hope it can scale. MongoDB is great for general document storage.<br>I am really looking forward to having more fun with WebSockets.</div></div><hr></div>
